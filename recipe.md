
1. In a large basin, combine all the dry components, such as plain flour, baking powder, cocoa powder, and bicarbonate soda. Then, you should take another basin or bowl to beat softened butter with eggs. This is exactly the moment when you can add one or two teaspoons of vanilla extract. Next, you need to add sugar to the wet ingredients, mixing them carefully at least for three minutes. Further, you should pour in the milk while carrying on beating: it is important to mix the components incessantly and intensely.

2. When you are ready with this, you can go over to the crucial point in making a chocolate cake, when two sets of ingredients are combined. Little by little, add the flour mixture to batter and mix it thoroughly until it is perfectly homogeneous and smooth. Now, you can finally give your hands a rest after tense mixing: it is time for the oven to work. Pour the batter evenly into carefully greased pan and bake the cake for thirty minutes. You may need additional time (up to five minutes), depending on the oven type and consistency of the batter, so it is always advisable to check the cake with a toothpick. When no traces of batter are noticeable on the toothpick, you can safely remove your airy chocolate cake out of the oven. Still, do not try to take it out of the pan until it cools completely; otherwise, it may sink in quite a disappointing way.

3. When the cake is on the table and your kitchen is filled with the wonderful aroma of vanilla and chocolate, you may think that your job is over. However, you need to put a finishing touch to make your cake even more tempting to your guests. Spend ten more minutes to make chocolate frosting, and your efforts will certainly be rewarded. Start with melting a bar of chocolate over a water bath. While it is cooling, beat two cups of softened butter with three tablespoons of milk for a couple of minutes. Next, add melted chocolate and a cup of sugar and carry on beating until the substance is creamy. As you finish, carefully spread the frosting over your chocolate cake: if you have troubles at this stage, it means that you have not reached the right consistency of the frosting.

4. Chocolate cake has always been an inalienable attribute of birthday celebrations. Though it can now be bought in every supermarket, the flavor and taste of homemade chocolate cake is still unsurpassable. Despite the common notion, it does not take much time or effort to cook it: only four stages are needed to make a tasty and spongy chocolate cake to surprise your guests.
